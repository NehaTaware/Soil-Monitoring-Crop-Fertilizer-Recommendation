# Soil Monitoring with Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation using IoT

This project is a smart agriculture solution that monitors soil conditions using IoT sensors and recommends suitable crops and fertilizers using machine learning.

## Features
- Real-time soil data collection (moisture, temperature, pH)
- Crop and fertilizer recommendation engine
- IoT hardware integration (e.g., sensors, Raspberry Pi/Arduino)
- Data preprocessing and visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning (sklearn, pandas, numpy)
- IoT hardware (sensors, microcontroller)
- Flask (for backend, optional)

## Future Improvements
- Add a mobile/web dashboard for live monitoring
- Use cloud services (Firebase/AWS IoT)
- Expand dataset for more accurate predictions
